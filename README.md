# ID3
A custom implementation of a decision tree classifier based on the ID3 algorithm, which uses information gain for attribute selection. Tree can handle categorical features as well as numeric ones. 

* [`decision_tree.py`](decision_tree.py) contains the actual implementation written in poor Python with the help of numpy to simplify the workflow with arrays
* [`examples.ipynb`](examples.ipynb) contains a few examples of applying the model on toy datasets
